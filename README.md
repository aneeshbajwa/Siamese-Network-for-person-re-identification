# Siamese-Network-for-person-re-identification
This project leverages the Siamese network for person re-identification. The training process involves a dataset comprising Anchor, Positive, and Negative images, which is used to train an efficient net model. The final layer of the efficient net is changed to yield 32-size vector encoding for each image. The Siamese network is subsequently trained using a triplet loss function as the cost criteria, with the optimization handled by the efficient Adam optimizer.
Once the model is finely tuned, a reference image is chosen, and a 32-size encoded vector is computed for this image by passing it through the trained efficient net model. This process is then replicated for all other images, generating corresponding encoded vectors. Utilizing the Euclidean distance as a parameter, the project identifies the five closest images to the reference image, to perform person re-identification.
