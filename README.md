# Siamese-Network-for-person-re-identification
This project leverages Siamese network for person re-identification. A dataset of Anchor, Positive and Negative images is used to train an efficient net model. Final layer of efficient net is changes to produce a 32 size encoded vector for each image. Then siamese network is trained using triplet loss function as criterion and adam optimizer.
